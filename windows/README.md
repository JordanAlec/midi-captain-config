# Windows

Please read the root [README](../README.md) for how to use. You will need to download the configurations your interested in, rename them and copy them to the correct folder, which the [README](../README.md) advices on.

## Note

The usefulness of these commands is largely for you to decide. My own personal opinion: I don't use these commands. For me, its much easier to remember the commands and your fingers are already on your keyboard. 

That said, it could be a great accessibility tool or a way to run shortcuts in custom programs.

## shortcuts.txt

You can also use this device to send HID keyboard commands!
This is used to run some basic keyboard shortcuts for Windows.

You can actually mix and match MIDI with these HID commands so a single page file can be used for multiple things.
This configuration file is largely an example file from the device when you initially plug it in.
I've changed some of the commands to make it more suitable for me and what I regularly use.

This file also includes comments to help with the syntax to write your own.
